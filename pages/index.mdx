# Nexus

Welcome to the Nexus developer documentation!

Here you can learn about the Nexus Network and the Nexus zkVM. Nexus is still under active development, but there are already several ways to get involved:

* [Use the zkVM](/zkvm)
* [Contribute compute to the network](/network)

## The Network

The Nexus Network is a massively-parallelized proof network for executing and proving the Nexus zkVM. See the [Network](/network) page for more information.

## The ZKVM

The Nexus zkVM can prove any computation. For a Rust program:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(target_arch = "riscv32", no_std, no_main)]

use nexus_rt::println;

fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}

#[nexus_rt::main]
fn main() {
    let n = 7;
    let result = fib(n);
    assert_eq!(result, 13);
    println!("fib({}) = {}", n, result);
}
```
