## Benchmark Host and Guest program

### Prerequisite

Before you start, please [install the latest Nexus zkVM and create a Nexus host project](https://docs.nexus.xyz/zkvm/sdk-quick-start).

This benchmark demonstrates the performance of Nexus zkVM using a Fibonacci sequence calculation as an example. We'll analyze both the guest program's RISC-V cycle count and the host program's execution time for various Fibonacci sequence lengths.

After running `cargo nexus host benchmark`, a new Rust `benchmark` project directory is created with the following structure:

```
./benchmark
├── Cargo.lock
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    ├── guest
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   ├── rust-toolchain.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── main.rs
    └── main.rs
```

The guest program is located in `src/guest/src/main.rs`, and the host program is located in `src/main.rs`.


### Host program

Let's modify the host program `src/main.rs` as follows:

```rust
use nexus_sdk::{
    compile::CompileOpts,
    nova::seq::{Generate, Nova, PP},
    Local, Prover, Verifiable,
};

const PACKAGE: &str = "guest";

fn generate_pp_and_compile() -> (PP, Nova<Local>) {
    let pp: PP = PP::generate().expect("failed to generate parameters");
    let opts = CompileOpts::new(PACKAGE);

    let prover: Nova<Local> = Nova::compile(&opts).expect("failed to compile guest program");

    (pp, prover)
}

fn prove_execution(pp: &PP, prover: Nova<Local>) -> nexus_sdk::nova::seq::Proof {
    prover.prove(pp).expect("failed to prove program")
}

fn verify_execution(pp: &PP, proof: &nexus_sdk::nova::seq::Proof) {
    proof.verify(pp).expect("failed to verify proof");
}

fn main() {
    use std::time::Instant;

    let start = Instant::now();
    let (pp, prover) = generate_pp_and_compile();
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    println!(
        "Time taken to generate PP and compile: {:.2} seconds",
        duration.as_secs_f64()
    );

    let start = Instant::now();
    let proof = prove_execution(&pp, prover);
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    println!(
        "Time taken to prove execution: {:.2} seconds",
        duration.as_secs_f64()
    );

    let start = Instant::now();
    verify_execution(&pp, &proof);
    let duration = start.elapsed();
    println!(
        "Time taken to verify execution: {:.2} seconds",
        duration.as_secs_f64()
    );
}
```

### Guest program

And the guest program in `src/guest/src/main.rs` is as follows:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

#[nexus_rt::profile]
fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    fib(n)
}

fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}

#[nexus_rt::main]
fn main() {
    let n = 5;
    assert_eq!(5, fibonacci(n));
}
```

`#[nexus_rt::profile]` macro is used to profile a function in the guest program.

### Fibonacci benchmark

The results below were obtained in 2024-08 on a MacBook Air M1 with 16 Gb of RAM.

#### Profile guest RISC-V Cycles count

In the `src/guest/` directory, run the command: `cargo nexus run 2>/dev/null`

Using the `#[nexus_rt::profile]` macro, the example output from `cargo nexus run` for the 10th Fibonacci number is:

```
The 10-th Fibonacci number is: 55
└── Total program cycles: 9928
    └──  'src/guest/src/main.rs:profile': 9750 cycles (98% of total)
```

#### Plotting the host and guest results

The graphs below illustrate the relationship between guest RISC-V cycles and host prover time for the Fibonacci sequence calculation.

Key observations:

1. Total execution time (represented by the number in each bar) includes:

- Public Parameters Generation
- Proving
- Verification

2. Performance breakdown:

- Verification time is negligible compared to proving time.
- Public parameters generation remains consistent at ~25 seconds across all iterations.
- Proving time increases significantly with the size of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Guest program optimization is crucial, as RISC-V cycles directly impact overall proving time.

### Suggestions for Developers

Based on the benchmark results, here are some key takeaways and suggestions for developers working with Nexus zkVM:

1. **Optimize Guest Programs**: Focus on minimizing RISC-V cycles in your guest programs. The benchmark clearly shows that the number of RISC-V cycles directly impacts overall proving time, which is the most significant component of total execution time.

2. **Consider Algorithm Efficiency**: When working on computationally demanding scenarios, prioritize efficient algorithm design and implementation. The Fibonacci sequence example demonstrates how complexity can quickly escalate proving time.

3. **Profile Regularly**: Regularly profile your Nexus zkVM projects using tools like `#[nexus_rt::profile]` to identify performance bottlenecks and opportunities for optimization.
