# The Nexus Network

<br />

The Nexus network is a massively-parallelized proof network for executing and proving the Nexus zkVM.

**Important:** *The Nexus network is currently in devnet. It is important to note that you cannot earn Nexus points. Instead, devnet allows developers to experiment and build with the network. Stay tuned for updates regarding future testnets.*
