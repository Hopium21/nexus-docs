# The Nexus Network

The Nexus network is a massively-parallelized proof network for executing and proving the Nexus zkVM.

**Important:** *The Nexus network is currently in devnet. It is important to note that you cannot earn Nexus points. Instead, devnet allows developers to experiment and build with the network. Stay tuned for updates regarding future testnets.*

## The intent of the network

### The problem developers face

To best understand the intent of the network, it is important to understand the problem it is trying to solve.

The Nexus zkVM is a general-purpose VM that can prove any computation. A developer can run it on their computer.

However, proving a small program can take a long time (even on a high-end computer, small non-trivial program can take hours or days). 

### The solution

The classic solution to this problem is for a developer to be able to deploy their program to third parties. These third parties can then run the program and prove it.

The Nexus network uses the latest advances in ZK where a program can be proven in parallel by many different parties.

### Current state

The network is currently in devnet.
